# Word-Cloud for common class names 

On the following website: [ClassNamer.org](www.ClassNamer.org) there are suggestions for class names:)

We want to create a word cloud (AKA tag cloud) - Examples here of the most common suggested words from the ClassNamer website. 
## Instructions 
* The word cloud data will be populated from at least 100 calls to the ClassNamer website. 

* Pay attention! Each result from the ClassNamer website consists of more than one word (Mostly 3 words) so you need to separate them into single words(By capital letters).
    * For example: 
PrintableResourceFactory ->[‘Printable’,’Resource’, ‘Factory’] 
    * The single words will be the words in the world-cloud 
* Every Refresh to the React App will get 100 new records from the ClassNamer website to create a new word cloud from the new data. 
Technical Requirements 
* The Application will have a client and server side preferably in Node.js and React 
* The code submission will be through your GitHub account 
* Pay attention to the number of calls to the ClassNamer website (what if we will need more than 100 calls)
